RSForm! Helper
==============

RSForm! Helper is a Joomla component to easily create emails for RSForm!Pro forms.
The component asks you to select a form and optionally supply some CSS styling for the caption column, value column and the whole table.

RSForm! Helper then generates a table with all the fields nicely formatted in two columns.
RSForm! Helper also generates PHP code to insert and update the form data in your own database tables.

I've added a bit of code to this marvelous component to generate the HTML used in the form display (front-end) in Joomla. It simply creates a DIV structured layout with the classes you provide in the settings.
